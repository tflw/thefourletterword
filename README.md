With there being an overall increase in the usage of the internet, now more than ever, it goes without saying that the use of hate speech and cyberbullying hasnâ€™t seen much of a halt. Even though social media has enabled reaching out to a majority of people, it has also caused there to be a plague of trolls who abuse and spread unnecessary hate, without realizing the impact a small line can have on people. 
 
We aim to devise a Machine Learning model/ algorithm that will enable the identification of and will flag offensive comments/ posts so that they can be removed, overall allowing for there to be the discouragement of hate speech. Companies and businesses can license our software through the website that will be home to the algorithm and implement as well as integrate it with their own systems to block disparaging comments and promote a safer and friendlier environment.
